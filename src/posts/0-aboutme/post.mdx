I had my very first `hello world` in 2012, written in C.

It didn't make me 'wow'. It didn't make me fall in love with programming and be excited about it.
In fact I found it was difficult and I was wondering for a long time if I had chosen the right field.

Those doubts followed me, until I started to code in Typescript.

It is such a great language!!!

It is so easy to start. Everything is typed, and therefore easy to read.

There's such a great community around it. There're so many frameworks. Standing on the shoulder of the giant makes me feel powerful.

I have never loved and appreciated the fact that I am a developer ever than before.

So I started this blog using Gatsby. I will put here things that I found useful, things that I think I may want to revisit in the future.

I hope this means my day of being an emotionless coding machine has ended :) And I can become one of those lucky ones who can say that they love what they are doing.

And I hope it makes me spend less time on PS4 :D
